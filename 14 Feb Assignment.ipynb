    "Advantages of Multithreading in Python\n",
    "Multithreading in Python has several advantages some of them are as below–\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory.\n",
    "2. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks.\n",
    "3. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance.\n",
    "4. You have now reached the end of the tutorial and successfully learned what is multithreading in Python. \n",

    "\n",
    "A program in execution is known as a process.\n",

    "User level thread can run on any operating system.\n",
    "Thread switching does not require Kernel mode privileges.\n",

    "\n",
    "Kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process on multiple processes.\n",
