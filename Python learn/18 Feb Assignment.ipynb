    "An API is a communication interface that allows two separate software components to share data. An API operates as a bridge between internal and external software operations, allowing for a fluid interchange of data that frequently passes undetected by the end-user. Simply said, an API acts as a virtual middleman, transferring data from one interface, such as a mobile app, to another. APIs connect various sections of a software platform to guarantee that information is sent correctly. These connection points serve as an internal communication route, and a way for external tools to access the same data. As a result, APIs may be classified into two types:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Uniform Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a key constraint that differentiate between a REST API and Non-REST API. It suggests that there should be an uniform way of interacting with a given server irrespective of device or type of application (website, mobile app). Specific resources should be identified in the request. Usually, they are described by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stateless\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that the necessary state to handle the request is contained within the request itself and server would not store anything related to the session. In REST, the client must include all information for the server to fulfill the request whether as a part of query params, headers or URI. Statelessness enables greater availability since the server does not have to maintain, update or communicate that session state. There is a drawback when the client need to send too much data to the server so it reduces the scope of network optimization and requires more bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cacheable\n",
    "\n",
    "Every response should include whether the response is cacheable or not and for how much duration responses can be cached at the client side. Client will return the data from its cache for any subsequent request and there would be no need to send the request again to the server. A well-managed caching partially or completely eliminates some client–server interactions, further improving availability and performance. But sometime there are chances that user may receive stale data. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Client-Server\n",
    "\n",
    "REST application should have a client-server architecture. A Client is someone who is requesting resources and are not concerned with data storage, which remains internal to each server, and server is someone who holds the resources and are not concerned with the user interface or user state. They can evolve independently. Client doesn’t need to know anything about business logic and server doesn’t need to know anything about frontend UI. \n",
    "Both client and server don’t need to know about other responsibilities. Thus, they can evolve independently. It allows using a single API in many different clients, e.g., web browsers, mobile apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Layered System\n",
    "\n",
    "A REST API can consist of multiple layers, eg., business logic, presentation, data access. Each layer doesn’t know any thing about any layer other than that of immediate layer and there can be lot of intermediate servers between client and the end server. Therefore, we can easily scale the system or provide additional layers such as gateways, proxies, load balancers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Code on Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an optional feature. According to this, servers can also provide executable code to the client. The examples of code on demand may include the compiled components such as JavaScript. \n",
    "The server can return a part of the code itself instead of the data in JSON format. The point is to provide specific operations on the data that the client can use directly."

    "SOAP is an stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is an XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging information among computers. SOAP is an application of the XML specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP architecture follows a client-server model and is based on the idea of sending XML messages over HTTP or other protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The SOAP architecture consists of four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SOAP Envelope:\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP envelope is the top-level element in a SOAP message and contains the XML namespace declarations and the SOAP header and body elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SOAP Header: \n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP header is an optional element that contains application-specific information, such as authentication credentials or message routing instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SOAP Body: \n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP body contains the actual XML message being exchanged between the client and server. This message can be a method call or a response to a method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. SOAP Fault:\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP fault element is used to convey error information back to the client if an error occurs during message processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is designed to be platform and language independent, making it a popular choice for web services that need to communicate across different systems. However, it has been largely replaced by RESTful web services, which are simpler and more lightweight.\n"

    "1. Complexity: \n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP can be quite complex and verbose, with a lot of overhead due to the use of XML. This can make it more difficult to implement and use compared to simpler protocols like REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Because SOAP uses XML, it can be slower and more resource-intensive than other protocols, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Security: \n",
    "\n",
    "While SOAP does support various security measures, such as SSL and WS-Security, implementing these measures can add complexity and overhead to the protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Limited browser support: \n",
    "\n",
    "Because SOAP requires XML parsing and is typically used with more complex web services, it is not well-suited for use in browser-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lack of flexibility: \n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a rigid protocol, with strict rules and standards for message structure and data types. This can make it difficult to work with in some cases where more flexibility is required."

    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two popular web service communication protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between REST and SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is an architectural style that follows a client-server model, while SOAP is a protocol with a specific set of rules for exchanging messages between computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is primarily based on HTTP and uses simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, while SOAP can use a variety of protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Message Format: \n",
    "\n",
    "REST typically uses JSON or XML format for message exchanges, while SOAP uses XML only.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ease of Use: \n",
    "\n",
    "REST is simpler and easier to use than SOAP. REST APIs are lightweight and require less bandwidth, while SOAP APIs are more complex and require more bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs are faster and more scalable than SOAP APIs because they use a lightweight message format and HTTP verbs, while SOAP APIs require a more robust message format and additional protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Security:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST has SSL and HTTPS for security. On other hand SOAP has SSL( Secure Socket Layer) and WS-security due to which in the cases like Bank Account Password, Card Number, etc. SOAP is preferred over REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Interchange:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST can make use of SOAP as the underlying protocol for web services, because in the end it is just an architectural pattern.On other hand SOAP cannot make use of REST since SOAP is a protocol and REST is an architectural pattern.\n"
